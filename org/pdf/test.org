#+TITLE: Test Plan

* Verification Overview
Subsystems that require computer vision or machine learning will first be
verified in a simulated environment off of the robot. These and the remaining
functions will be verified within several test environments designed on the
Florida Tech campus. Environments will include paved and grass areas to assess
the robotâ€™s movement capabilities. Each system function will be tested
independently, through unit tests, before system testing occurs. Test courses of
varying depth and difficulty will be constructed with, but not limited to,
masking tape, white ribbon, paint, furniture, and cones. Furthermore, data will
be collected from these test courses to improve simulation testing.
* Lane Detection
The lane detection model, and lane following subsystem, will be tested off of
the robot using collected data. The model will be tested on test courses from
which additional data will be gathered to improve the model. After the robot can
reliably detect lanes, the subsystem will be tested concurrently with the
Obstacle Avoidance subsystem.
* Obstacle Avoidance
The obstacle avoidance subsystem will be initially tested off of the robot using
collected data and simulations. The model will then be tested on test courses,
from which additional data will be gathered to improve the model. After the
robot can reliably detect obstacles, the subsystem will be tested concurrently
with the Lane Following subsystem.
* Mapping
The mapping subsystem will be tested independently simulating the outputs from
the lane detection and obstacle detection submodule. After verifying that the
mapping module is capable of understanding the input and accurately map objects
on the virtual map, it will be tested using real input from the detection
subsystems.
* Path planning
Path planning will be tested initially on the robot without other functions. The
robot will be provided a simple map of the robot and its waypoints' positions.
After it demonstrates it can successfully traverse to a waypoint, additional
complexities will be added
