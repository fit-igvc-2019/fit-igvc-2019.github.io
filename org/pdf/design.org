#+TITLE: Design Document

* Overview
The purpose of the system is to traverse the Auto-Nav Challenge course at the
2020 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. The system will traverse a course
defined by white-painted lanes and various obstacles.

The robot must be capable of:
- Detecting the lane and travel within track of the competition
- Detecting and avoiding obstacles
- Navigating to specified waypoints
- Traveling as far as possible within limited time.

In order to achive this, the robot must have these modules:
- Camera and sensors.
- Images processing:
  - Lane detection
  - Obstacle detection
- Mapping
- Motion planning

* Modules:
** Camera and sensors
This module is responsible for gathering and sending data from the camera and
sensors.
** Images processing
These functions allow the robot to detect elements of the environment using the data from the
camera and sensors. After processing these elements into a more accessible
format, the data will be sent to the mapping functions.
*** Lane detection
This module allows the robot to recognize the patterns of the lane.
*** Obstacle detection
This module allows the robot to detect the position and size of the obstacle.
** Mapping
This module will gather the processed data and display them on a virtual map.
The map will show the positions of the robot, the waypoints, the obstacles and
the lane.
** Motion planning
From the data in the virtual map, the robot will find a path from its
position to the waypoint. The path will be subjected to change as more data from
the course is gathered.

After finding a path, this module will control the robot to physically follow
this path plan.
