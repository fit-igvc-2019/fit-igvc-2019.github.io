* Goal and Motivation
The goal of the project is to build an unmanned autonomous robot to compete in
IGVC in Michigan. The objective of the competition is to have the robot complete
an outdoor obstacle course under a prescribe time within the speed limit of 1-5
mph while remaining on the lane and avoiding obstacles.
* Approach:
The key features of the software components are:
- Lane detection
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Mapping
- Motion planning

The robot must be able to follow the path specified by the competition. The
boundary of this path will be illustrated by dashed or continuous white lines.
Lane detection is necessary for the robot to detect these boundaries.

Within the course, there will be natural and artificial obstacbles. Obstacle
detection and avoidance allow the robot to detect obstacbles and move around
them. Avoiding obstacles is a key factor of the competition.

Mapping let the robot construct a virtual map of the obstacle course using the
data from lane detection and obstacle detection. With mapping, the robot can
remember the collected data and avoid redundant data collection. In addition,
the robot can remember the where it has been and avoid backtracking.

Motion planning is a crucial feature of the robot. Using motion planning, the
robot can construct the shortest path to the checkpoints from the data
illustrated in the map. Efficient motion planning is essential for finishing the
course in time.

* Technical Challenges:
- Team members have no experience with creating 3D environment in order to creat
  software simulation
- We need to decide on motion planning algorithm
- We need to find a way to detect obstacle
* Milestone 4:
- Creating an emulation environment to test the software
- Test the software using the emulation
* Milestone 5:
- Implement obstacle detection and motion planning
- Create poster for Senior design showcase
* Milestone 6:
- Test/demo of the entire system
- Evaluation results
- Create user manual
- Create demo video
* Design:
[[../../static/design-diagram.png]]
- All data collected by the camera will be processed and sent to the mapping
  module. Using the map, the robot's motion planning system will find a path to
  the destination
- The success of the project is defined by how the robot perform in the competition:
  - Can the robot participate in the competition?
  - Within the time robot, how far can the robot travel? Can the robot reach the goal.
* Progress Summary:
| Task                                | Completion % | Viet Dung | To do                                      |
|-------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------|
| Examine options for motion planning |           50 |        50 | Decide the algorithm                       |
| Implement and test lane detection   |           80 |        80 | Improve the accuracy of the lane detection |
| Implement and test mapping          |           80 |        80 | Require integration testing                |
* Description:
- Create a 3D simulation :: It is not possible to test all the software changes
  on the robot. Creating a simulation environment is necessary for testing.

* Approval from Faculty Sponsor:
- I have discussed with the team and approve this project plan. I will evaluate the progress and assign a grade for each of the three milestones."
