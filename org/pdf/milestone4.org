* Task Discussion:
** Rewrite codes into ROS nodes:
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a set of tools and libraries for making robot
applications.

Different components in the robot system will communicate with each other using
ROS message and service systems. Using the =rospy= library, we rewrite the
existing Python codes into ROS nodes by using ROS Subscriber and Publisher as
input and output.

** Build the Gazebo simulation:
Gazebo is an application used for robot simulation. Using Gazebo, we can test
the robot specification. Gazebo also comes with a plugin simulating the output
of a depth camera and publish the image to ROS nodes.

The simulation includes the models for the robot and a map using 2d image as
texture on plain surface. In order to move the robot, we wrote a plugin to
control the robot joints.
** Test the simulation:
The Ros nodes will subscribe to the topic published by Gazebo. In testing, each
Ros nodes will display its output in order to test the software.

The lane detection node will find the white lines drawn on the map and published
the filtered image to the mapping node.

The mapping node will receive the image from the lane detection. It will get the
robot's position using Gazebo existing ROS services =get_model_state= and
calculate the robot's orientation on the 2D plane from the Gazebo quarternions
orientation (x, y, z, w)

* Contribution discussion:
- Viet Dung Nguyen
  + Improve the Gazebo models, correct the coordinates of the robot model's
    components.
  + Draw the map for the simulation.
  + Write the Gazebo plugin to move the robot.
  + Rewrite the lane detection and mapping modules into ROS nodes.
  + Testing the simulation. Verify that the nodes are working as intended.
  + Write the documentation. Describe the process for building and testing the
    project.
* Plan for the next milestone:
- Implement motion planning.
  - Using the map, find the way from the robot current position to the next
    waypoint.
  - Plan the robot motion, calculate the speed of the robot joints in order to
    control the robot movement.
- Create poster for Senior design showcase.
