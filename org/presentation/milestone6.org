* Task Discussion:

** Assist other member with the simulation:
- Adjust the build script for different Linux distros.
- When using ROS1 with Python3, the users must specify the location of Python 3.
  - Different between distros.

** Refactor the code:
- Improve the mapping function.
  - Previous method:
    - Extract the list of coordinates of objects (obstacle, lane)
    - Perform rotation and scaling on the list using transformation matrices.
  - Current method:
    - Perform rotation and scaling on the image using OpenCV provided methods.
    - Extract the coordinates

** Adding obstacles:
- Add the model for obstacle and place obstacles on simulation.

* Contribution discussion:

  + Improve the mapping function
  + Create the model for obstacle
  + Change the map.
* Lessons learned:
- Learn how to use ROS
  - Writing publisher, subscriber and custom ROS msg and service
- Learn how to use Gazebo for simulation:
  - Design models using specification document
  - Writing plugins for controlling robot
- Learn more about image filtering and mapping
