* Goal and Motivation
The goal of the project is to build an unmanned autonomous robot to compete in
IGVC in Michigan. The objective of the competition is to have the robot complete
an outdoor obstacle course under a prescribe time within the speed limit of 1-5
mph while remaining on the lane and avoiding obstacles.
* Approach:
The key features of the software components are:
- Lane detection
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Mapping
- Motion planning
* Progress Summary:

* Technical Challenges:
- Team members have no experience with creating 3D environment in order to creat
  software simulation
- We need to decide on motion planning algorithm
- We need to find a way to detect obstacle
* Milestone 4:
- Creating an emulation environment to test the software
- Test the software using the emulation
* Milestone 5:
- Implement and test obstacle detection
- Implement and test motion planning
- Create poster for Senior design showcase
* Milestone 6:
- Test/demo of the entire system
- Evaluation results
- Create user manual
- Create demo video
* Questions?
