#+TITLE: IGVC Milestone 1

* Implement lane detection
Using image processing technique, find the lane that the robot must follow.

* Implement lane detection: Filters
Combine multiple filters to find the lane
* RGB Variance:
Filters the pixels if the 3 color channel is different from each other.

* Luminance:
Using the luminance channel in HSL colorspace in order to find brighter area.

* Implement lane detection: Other image processing technique
- Using median blur in order to reduce the noise in image while maintaining the edge
- Using opencv2 morphology in order to fill the small spot
* Implement lane detection: Drawback
- The threshold value for the filter must be adjust accordingly to the environment.
- Currently, the functions cannot differentiate the white paint from the light
  reflected on the metal surface or other white object.
- The team is looking into using pattern recognition in order to refine the
  result.
* Implement lane detection: Drawback

* Implement lane detection: Failed approach
- Considered using sliding windows and histograms for finding the curve of the
  lane, but the method is not suitable.

* Test lane detection
Currently, the team is using a script to apply the lane detection to all test
input and manually checking the result.

* Next milestone
Implement and test mapping.

* Questions?
