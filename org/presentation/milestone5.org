#+TITLE: IGVC Milestone 5

* Task matrix:
#+LATEX: \small
| Task                         | Completion % |
|------------------------------+--------------|
| Software Documentation       |           80 |
| Improving the simulation     |           50 |
| Control the robot movement   |          100 |

* Change of plan:
- Because of the situation with the Coronavirus, the team could physically
  access the robot.
- Focus more on documentation and simulation.
- Prioritize software development over hardware

* Documentation:
- Instruction :: instruction for building and running the simulation.
- Resources :: A list of reference material for learning and editting the
  project.
  - Included adjustments apply to the material

* Improve experience for running and building software:
- Create a ROS launch file, which run multiple ROS nodes at the same time.
- Include a makefile to setup environment, build and run the project.

* Control the robot movement:
- The robot moves and turns by adjusting the speed of two rear wheels.
- Create a custom ROS message to provide interface for controlling the robot
  movement.
- Currently used to manually control the robot.
- When the motion planning module can be integrate, the robot's movement can be automated.

* Contribution discussion:
- Viet Dung Nguyen
  + Write the document for the simulator.
  + Streamline the process for building and running the simulator.
  + Update the plugin, which provided interface for movement control.
  + Consult about the implementation of other members work into the simulation.
* Plan for the next milestone:
- Improve the documentation:
  - Included coding standard and practice for editting the project.
- Refactor the code:
  - Modularize the path filtering in order to hotswap filters.
  - Changing the parameters of the mapping module with a config file or
    environment variables.
- Assist other members with including their works into the simulation.
* Questions?
