* Testing Document
- List the test cases for each subsystem.
  - Independent testing
  - System testing / Integration testing.
* Establish best practices
- The team chose C++ and Python for the project's software.
- The team was able to chose tools for enforcing the code standard.
* Examine the legacy code
- Read and examine the code from last year project.
- Unable to test it due to hardware condition.
* Examine options for motion planning
- The team was able to learn more about motion planning.
- Motion planning algorithm will be chosen after implementing and testing other functions.
* Milestone 2
- Test the legacy code
  + Find the replacement parts for the robot to make it functional and test the
    code from last year project.
- Implement and test obstacle and/or lane detection
  + Read the document on ZED camera and write ROS node(s) for detection functions.
* Question?
